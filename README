Instructions:

*We have applied the Google Maps API in our app, which is a restricted service. To enable this feature on any new emulator before testing, we need to add your SHA1 fingerprint on our Google Cloud Platform. To obtain your SHA1 fingerprint, please follow these steps:

1.	Click on AndroidStudio->Preference/Settings->Experimental.
2.	Uncheck the box of “Only include test tasks in the Gradle task list generated during Gradle Sync”.
3.	Click on Gradle->Project name (Should be Empty)->Tasks->android->signingReport.
4.	The output will include a bunch of codes, including the SHA1 fingerprint, which will look something like this: SHA1: 1D:21:39:9D:B0:57:35:A3:CC:BF:BC:E0:14:DA:37:49:14:D6:A2:DF.

* Please note that all emulators have a default location in California, where Google headquarters is located. However, our app restricts the map range to JHU Homewood Campus since it is only available to BlueJay users. Therefore, to see your current location on the map, you need to reset your location. Follow these steps:

1.	Click on the three dots under the emulator bar.
2.	Go to Location->input the name of any building in our Homewood campus->select the “Set Location” button at the lower right corner.

* Additionally, our app requires users to authorize the Location function inside the emulator settings before using its map function. If you open the app without authorizing the Location function, you won’t see your current location on the map, although the app won't crash."


* When the user first clicked into the app, they will be assigned a random user id at the welcome page and the id will be where their task information will be stored on the database. Before then, the user would not have any default data, so their map will remain blank until they actually complete / fail a task.

* To work on a task, user can click on the "+" button at the buttom of the map page. After choosing the time using the progress bar, the user can then start a task and see the countdown timer.

* By clicking on the cancel button at the bottom, the user can attempt to cancel the current task. This will bring the user to the Quit Warning page, where the user can either choose to go back and resume the countdown or quit and have a failed record.

* After the timer is completed, the user will see a pop up window celebrating their completion and will then be brought back to the map page.

* A completion or a failure would be recorded on firebase and reflected on the map. Note that since the emulator location is manually set, one potential problem may be all the markers are stacked together. To see dots at different positions, user can manually add records on our firebase realtime database using the link below:

https://console.firebase.google.com/project/earlyjay-b4f20/database/earlyjay-b4f20-default-rtdb/data

* However, upon the first entry, the user might need to share their email / gmail account with our team members so that we can share the firebase site.
